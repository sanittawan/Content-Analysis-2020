## Note on homework 8

Since the output of these models are very lengthy, it might be easier for you to open my notebook in colab.

Colab has a left panel where you can navigate from section to section easily. I completed my work in colab, so it should be easy for you to click on the colab button at the top of the notebook and open it. 

I also generated a copy of the notebook where you can view it at this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qV-PmWcWUNcAQn71XQuEy5O37P-l1IUN)
